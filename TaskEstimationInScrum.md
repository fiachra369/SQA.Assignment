### Task estimation techniques


#### Experience
- Draw on previous experience to better predict how many hours will be needed for the sprint
- Can apply to non-developers in equal measure
- Not an exact science but definitely a useful tool for better estimation

#### Ask an expert
- If you have no expertise yourself, it is difficult to accurately determine time for tasks
- There is no shame in asking someone who knows better than you do
- This method can prove to be very efficient


#### Estimation games
- This involves gathering people and putting them into teams
- A bracket format means each team enters their estimation and the closest guess wins
- This method is more involving, light-hearted and can produce great results




### Tips and tricks

#### Create a reasonable buffer
- You always need to give yourself some breathing room to account for setbacks/incidents
- It must be a reasonable time period. Not too long, not too short
- Not the most scientific method but it proves to be very effective

#### Never be afraid to ask
- It is always beneficial to get a different perspective on your work
- Other people will spot problems that you may not even consider

#### Choose the most suitable methods
- Communicating everything through email can be difficult to follow
- I used Jira personally in my internship and found the Kanban board very helpful 
- Other examples include Asana, Microsoft Planner
