# Task Estimation in Scrum

## Importance of task estimation  

- Need to know how long a task is going to take for the team
- Want to deliver efficiently and as fast as possible
- Allows for more up-to-date status reports regarding the sprint
- Resources are shared between tasks, so itâ€™s important to know resource dependencies and related time
- To move on to new tasks

## Common Challenges of Task Estimation

### Idealistic & optimistic estimation

- In most cases, the estimation is carried out under ideal and optimistic conditions, but issues such as unavailability of certain resources, and change requests during the project are not considered in the project estimation.

### Poor design

- A poor design results in unnecessary code tweaking and heavy-duty maintenance applying pressure on schedules.

### Not splitting the tasks enough

- Most projects have a WBS (Work breakdown structure) and Each task unit should be equivalent to an Agile story point.
- Lack of this usually implies that there is no proper basis for estimation and then well, it slips out into a subjective guess.

### Ignoring team capacity

- It seems obvious that different people would take different time to code. But when we draw estimates, we come up with a standard effort estimate. This inherently adds a risk layer which is going to make the estimate unreliable.

### Task estimation techniques


#### Experience
- Draw on previous experience to better predict how many hours will be needed for the sprint
- Can apply to non-developers in equal measure
- Not an exact science but definitely a useful tool for better estimation

#### Ask an expert
- If you have no expertise yourself, it is difficult to accurately determine time for tasks
- There is no shame in asking someone who knows better than you do
- This method can prove to be very efficient


#### Estimation games
- This involves gathering people and putting them into teams
- A bracket format means each team enters their estimation and the closest guess wins
- This method is more involving, light-hearted and can produce great results




### Tips and tricks

#### Create a reasonable buffer
- You always need to give yourself some breathing room to account for setbacks/incidents
- It must be a reasonable time period. Not too long, not too short
- Not the most scientific method but it proves to be very effective

#### Never be afraid to ask
- It is always beneficial to get a different perspective on your work
- Other people will spot problems that you may not even consider

#### Choose the most suitable methods
- Communicating everything through email can be difficult to follow
- I used Jira personally in my internship and found the Kanban board very helpful 
- Other examples include Asana, Microsoft Planner
