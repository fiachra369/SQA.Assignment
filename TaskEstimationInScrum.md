# Task Estimation in Scrum

## Importance of task estimation  

- Need to know how long a task is going to take
- Want to deliver efficiently and as fast as possible
- Allows for more up-to-date status reports regarding the sprint
- Resources are shared between tasks, so itâ€™s important to know resource dependencies and related time
- To move on to new tasks

## Common Challenges of Task Estimation

### Idealistic & optimistic estimation

- In most cases, the estimation is carried out under ideal and optimistic conditions, but issues such asunavailability of certain resources, and change requests during the project are not considered in the project estimation.

### Poor design

- A poor design results in unnecessary code tweaking and heavy-duty maintenance applying pressure on schedules.

### Not splitting the tasks enough

- Most projects have a WBS (Work breakdown structure) and Each task unit should be equivalent to an Agile story point.
- Lack of this usually implies that there is no proper basis for estimation and then well, it slips out into a subjective guess.

### Ignoring team capacity

- It seems obvious that different people would take different time to code. But when we draw estimates, we come up with a standard effort estimate. This inherently adds a risk layer which is going to make the estimate unreliable.

### Benefits of estimating twice 


#### More control
- Makes creation of a burn-down chart much easier
- Enables daily sprint checks increasing efficiency
- Allows for more up-to-date status reports regarding the sprint

#### Accuracy
- Allows you to break down work into smaller tasks
- Smaller tasks provide more clarity to the overall sprint


#### Easier planning
- Holidays and sick days can be accounted for
- Differing capacities of team members can be taken into account




### Conclusions

There are clear advantages and disadvantages to estimating in hours after you already estimated in Story Points. When you have a stable team velocity, then it may not be necessary to estimate in hours. There are some companies that view estimation as an activity that doesn't add value and for that reason it should not be done.
Estimating in hours goes along with the practices involved in Scrum. It provides a learning curve and gives more accurate sprint plan. It is crucial that all team members see the benefit in counting hours or else it may prove to be a waste of time.
