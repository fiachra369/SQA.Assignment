## What did you like in the task?
- Team worked well together considering the circumstances
- Whole group had a great understanding of the gitflow process, some having previous experience
- Group were willing to learn from other members of the group and took pull request reviews onboard
- Team gained an extensive knowledge on markdowns
- Tasks were completed in a professional and timely manner considering the big workload coming up to spring break
 
## What didn't work well?
- Communication could have been better between pull requests, often pull request were left for hours without being accepted
- Team was not as strong at using git from the command line
 
## What are your improvement ideas?
- We would have liked to start a little earlier than we did, as external worked started to pile up
- I think one or two more calls explaining how git flow process works to team members would have benefited a lot
