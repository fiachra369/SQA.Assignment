# Project Plan

## Introduction

Our goal for this "handbook" is to give Codeck Software the best possible resource to ensure developers follow the best and most effective practices. Not only will this project massively benefit the QA team, but it will help new recruits into Codeck understand what is expected of them and ensure a smooth integration into the company. We hope once the handbook is read, that all members in Codeck Software understand the benefits that qualilty coding practices offer to an organisation's long-term success.

## Project Tasks
- Task Estimation in Scrum
- Coding Standards
- Code Reviews

Before tackling any of the task, we first had a meeting via Teams to establish where everyone's strengths are and which part they would like to work on. Thus, we decided it was best for two people to do the first task, two to do the second and finally for the last task for us all to contribute to it and show that we can work collaboratively as a team. Then, during our first meeting, we made sure each member in the group understood the gitflow process as it something completely new to everyone.

- Task Estimation in Scrum = Victor & Mark
- Coding Standards = Siobhan & Fiachra
- Code Reviews = Whole Group

We have decided as a group to complete the first two tasks by Sunday (four days from first meeting). Once these tasks are complete, we will have a new meeting and decide when and how we will finish the final part together.

## Victor & Marks Plan for Task Estimation in Scrum Task


## Fiachra & Siobhan Plan for Coding Standards Task
- Meeting the day after first group meeting to discuss which standards we would like to include and the length of each standard
- Research any relevant material i.e images, blogs, quotes that would benefit the handbook
