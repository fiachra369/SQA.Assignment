#Project Plan

#Introduction

Our goals for this "handbook" is to give Codeck Software the best possible resource for them to insure their QA teams follow the best and most effective practices. Not only will this project massively benefit the QA team, but it will help new recruits into Codeck understand what is expected of them. We hope once the handbook is read, that all memebers in Codeck Software undertstand the benefits that qualilty coding practices offer to an organisations long term success.

#Project Tasks
- Task Estimation in Scrum
- Coding Standards
- Code Reviews

Before tackling any of the task, we first had a meeting via Teams to establish where everyones strenghts are and which part they would like to work on. Thus, we decided is was best for each 2 to do the first task, 2 to do the second and finally for the last task for us all to contribute to it and show that we can work capibly as a team. Then, during our first meeting, we made sure each member in the group understood the gitflow process as it something completly new to everyone.

- Task Estimation in Scrum = Victor & Mark
- Coding Standards = Siobhan & Fiachra
- Code Reviews = Whole Group

We have decided as group to complete the first two tasks by Sunday(4 days from first meeting). Once these tasks are complete, we will have a new meeting and decide when and how we will finish the final part together.
